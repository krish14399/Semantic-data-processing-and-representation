## First Aid Chat Bot

This chatbot is designed to provide general information and advice based on the symptoms the user describes. It aims to assist users by suggesting potential causes for their symptoms and offering general recommendations for self-care. However, it emphasizes that it is not a replacement for professional medical advice, and users are encouraged to consult with a healthcare professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized treatment plan. The chatbot's role is to guide users toward seeking appropriate medical attention and to provide general support in the interim.
